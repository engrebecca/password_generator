# Secure Password Generator

## Summary
Is your password secure? To ensure your sensitive data is protected, a secure password generator is the best option for creating safe and strong passwords.

The Secure Password Generator creates a randomized password based on your requested criteria. It allows you to create passwords with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Passwords can range in length from 8 to 28 characters.

## How It Works
The generator uses JavaScript to prompt a user for password criteria, validate criteria, and then generate a password. The JavaScript code is comprised of alert/prompt/confirm methods, variables, arrays, functions, if/else statements, and string methods. The Document Object Model (DOM) is accessed with JavaScript to hook onto elements and create dynamic features.
